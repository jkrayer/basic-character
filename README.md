### TODO
 9. Form needs to validate inputs
 11. Caching API Calls
 12. Organization of Responsibilities of components - feels dirty to have routing logic and server logic in views/CreateCharacter.vue. But maybe this is like the "controller" component and so data fetching and route handling belong at this level.
 13. Update error message for score form on the fly
